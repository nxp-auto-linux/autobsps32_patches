This section contains patches for the BSP that are not planned for inclusion in
the BSP, but might be useful for specific purposes (e.g. an example patch on
how to reserve a memory block from the DTS).

The directories' filenames should make it clear to which software versions do
the patches apply, or on which versions they were initially implemented.
